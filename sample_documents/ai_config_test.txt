DocParser AI Configuration Test Document

This is a plain text document for testing the new configurable AI integration system in DocParser v2.1.

Key Testing Areas:
==================

1. Multi-Provider Support
   - OpenAI GPT models
   - Anthropic Claude models  
   - Google Gemini models
   - Replicate hosted models

2. Configuration Management
   - YAML-based configuration files
   - Environment variable support
   - Provider-specific settings
   - Model parameter customization

3. Fallback Mechanisms
   - Provider failure handling
   - Graceful degradation to basic analysis
   - User-friendly error messages

4. Security Features
   - Secure credential storage
   - Environment variable resolution
   - No hardcoded API keys

Testing Scenarios:
==================

- Test with no AI providers configured
- Test with invalid credentials
- Test with multiple providers enabled
- Test fallback order functionality
- Test configuration validation

Performance Considerations:
===========================

The new system should maintain the same performance characteristics as the original while adding flexibility. The fallback system ensures that DocParser remains functional even without AI providers configured.

Content Analysis Expected:
==========================

When AI is available, this document should be analyzed for:
- Document structure and organization
- Technical content identification
- Testing methodology description
- Configuration management patterns

When AI is unavailable, basic analysis should identify:
- File type (TXT)
- Content length statistics
- Presence of structured sections
- General document characteristics
